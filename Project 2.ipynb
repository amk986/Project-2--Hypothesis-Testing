    "Each year, the city of Boston develops a report and dataset containing information on the average earnings per department for each city department. They analyze several dependent and independent variables such as each employee's name, the department they work for, job title, regular salary, overtime salary, injury salary, educative salary, and total earnings. The City of Boston develops these reports and datasets annually in order to monitor and manage the budget the city maintains in order to pay for its' city employees. It is crucial to analyze this data set and these specific variables to analyze how average annual salaries earned and average total earnings per department has changed each year. Although in my analysis, I am only focusing on the 2018 dataset. "
